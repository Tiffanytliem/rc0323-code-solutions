## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
In ES6, destructuring is an alternative way to assign properties of an object/array to variables.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
let {property1: variable1, property2: variable2} = object;

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
let [variable1, variable2] = array;

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
the difference is with creating object/array literals, the name of the object/array is declared and on the left side of the assignment operator. With destructuring, the already declared name of the object/array is on the right side of the assignment operator.
