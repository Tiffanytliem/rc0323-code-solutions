## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
function are codes that are written to be reuse throughout a program.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
to define a function, we first use the function keyword, give it a name, include parameters seperated by commas and surrounded by parentheses, then start the function's code block with an {, write code and then return statement (optional), close the function with a }.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
to call a function, we write the name of the function, plug in the arguments surrounded by parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
function definition is the first step of writing a function. we can give it a name and refine how many parameters we want the function to take.

function call is when we want a specific, already defined function to give a result by calling its name and giving with the arguments.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
a parameter is a placeholder without a specific value. an argument is a sopecific value assigned to that parameter.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
parameters are useful because it allows the function to receive data when it is called and generate the result based on those data.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
return statement causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
return statement presents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
